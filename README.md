# Google-Address-Check
This is a tkinter GUI to geocode addresses or business-name-address combinations using Google Maps API.

The user needs to provide their own Google Maps API key.
The current version reads an excel file and outputs another excel file. You can choose the business name, address, city, zipcode, ... fields.

Since Google API is not free, and API queries are not fast, I use this program to geocode addresses when the addresses are not found in other systems, like NYC GBAT, because of typos and changed addresses.

Another advantage of this program is that it can search for business names in Google Maps.
